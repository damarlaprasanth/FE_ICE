India will be locking horns with the West Indies in a three-match One Day International series the first of which will be played on Friday, July 22. The Men in Blue would be upbeat heading into this series having registered a comprehensive 2-1 win last week against England. Meanwhile, the hosts would be desperate to make amends in the 50-overs format after a recent 0-3 drubbing in the home series against Bangladesh.

The Indian team will be led by senior batter Shikhar Dhawan with star all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja as his deputy. Regular skipper Rohit Sharma has been rested for the One Day series, but he will be back in action for the five T20Is. With the likes of key players including Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant rested, it would be a perfect opportunity for the emerging players as well as the bench strength to prove their mettle on the field.

There could be a lot of auditions in the bowling department as well as the middle-order with an eye on next year’s ODI World Cup and therefore, all the players would be hoping to make the maximum use of the opportunities presented to them and play an important role in winning the series.

The first ODI will be played on the 22nd of July while the second and the third One Day Internationals will be played on July 24th and 27th respectively. The ODI series will be held at the Queen’s Park Oval in Port of Spain, Trinidad.

While the ODI series will be entirely contested at the same venue, even the timings remain the same for all three matches as they will kick off from 7 PM IST onwards. The games would be live-streamed on the FanCode app whereas DD are extended broadcasters.
