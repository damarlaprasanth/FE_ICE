People in India are yet to overcome their loss to New Zealand in the semi-final of the 2019 World Cup. A lot of questions were raised regarding the tactics at that time. Now, even three years later, Parthiv Patel is still surprised with the decision of sending MS Dhoni at number seven.

With 240 to chase, India lost some quick wickets early on. Despite that, the management decided to send Dinesh Karthik and Hardik Pandya ahead of much experienced MS Dhoni. The fans generally believe that the former India captain could’ve helped to stabilize India’s batting unit. Meanwhile Karthik and Pandya could’ve come later on to accelerate.

During a discussion on Cricbuzz, the former wicketkeeper-batter once again raised the point of sending Dhoni down the order. He believes that Dhoni should have been sent up in order to stabilize the ship.

“In the 2019 World Cup semi-final, we sent Dinesh Karthik to bat at five and MS Dhoni at seven. I don’t know if MS Dhoni was going to win you the game from the dressing room”, said Parthiv in the show.

Speaking on the show, Parthiv pointed out the mistakes that team India made over the years. He believes that not picking Yuzvendra Chahal in the last T20 World Cup was a huge mistake while bowling first in the Champions Trophy final was tactically a wrong move.

Parthiv said, “when you look at the Champions Trophy final (2017), India got it wrong tactically by deciding to bowl first on that wicket. Or in the 2019 World Cup, we didn’t get our team right as we couldn’t find a No.4 batter for two years.”
