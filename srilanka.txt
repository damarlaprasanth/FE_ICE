Danushka Gunathilaka stumbles a touch, and looks back at an off stump. It is still convulsing, as if it has 10,000 volts run through it. Haris Rauf tears away in his follow through, his team-mates racing after him. The stadium is a riot of fluttering Pakistan flags, and noise.

It is the most spectacular moment in an incandescent passage of fast bowling. Earlier, Naseem's Shah's vicious inswinger had also made an eruption out of the woodwork, but this ball to Gunathilaka, oh man - that's unplayable. Angled across, straightening in the air, seaming off the pitch. On his best day, Gunathilaka is not hitting that. No one is. It is a meteor. It has scorched through the atmosphere at 151kph.

Pakistan do this. They've been doing this. In limited-overs cricket, no modern side places so much of their pride on the altar of fast bowling, and when they've caught fire in finals, they've razed oppositions to the ground. Mohammad Amir and Hasan Ali were an inferno against India in the 2017 Champions Trophy. Against a much more decorated Sri Lanka top order than the one in this Asia Cup, Pakistan's quicks had been in searing form in the 2009 T20 World Cup title match.


Today, they've got Sri Lanka reeling at three down by the end of the powerplay, and in the first three overs of spin, Pakistan take two more wickets. Sri Lanka are 58 for 5, at a venue that favours chasing sides so severely, only three teams have batted first and won, in the 21 previous T20Is here.


After 8.5 overs, Sri Lanka are down to their last three recognised batters, two of whom are bowling allrounders. ESPNcricinfo's Win Probability tracker has their chances at 15.74%. That percentage does not account for emotion, but when you're in the maws of a great Pakistan bowling performance, it is as if the world closes in.


Sri Lanka had had a good run, turned heads, and sprung surprise. There's no shame in succumbing to bowling of this quality. Because surely they will not win from here.
